Grindlists is a web application designed to help gamers organize their grinding
sessions. For any readers who don't know what that means, sometimes a game
requires a player to collect materials to complete a quest or craft an item.
This process is often referred to as "Grinding".
Sometimes those items also require crafting intermediate items, and it can be a
lot to keep track of. The goal of Grindlists is to help gamers keep track of
what items they need, how many they need, and where those items can be found.

Grindlists allows you to quickly create a new list, and fill that list with items
by simply typing them out. If the item doesn't exist it will be created, and if it
does exist (i.e. you've used it in another list) it will be displayed as an option
as you type. Then, you can change the quantity if more than one instance of that
item is required. Feel free to try it out at [https://grindlists.leggett.dev]!

Grindlists has undergone a few iterations, it is currently written in the
[T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg), which is composed of Typescript with Next.js
for the frontend, Typescript with [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for the api layer,
and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) for the database layer.
