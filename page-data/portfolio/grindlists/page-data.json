For any readers who don't know what that means, sometimes a game\nrequires a player to collect materials to complete a quest or craft an item.\nThis process is often referred to as \"Grinding\".\nSometimes those items also require crafting intermediate items, and it can be a\nlot to keep track of. The goal of Grindlists is to help gamers keep track of\nwhat items they need, how many they need, and where those items can be found.\n\nGrindlists allows you to quickly create a new list, and fill that list with items\nby simply typing them out. If the item doesn't exist it will be created, and if it\ndoes exist (i.e. you've used it in another list) it will be displayed as an option\nas you type. Then, you can change the quantity if more than one instance of that\nitem is required. Feel free to try it out at [https://grindlists.leggett.dev](https://grindlists.leggett.dev)!\n\nGrindlists has undergone a few iterations, it is currently written in the\n[T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg), which is composed of Typescript with Next.js\nfor the frontend, Typescript with [tRPC](https://trpc.io) for the api layer,\nand [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) for the database layer.\n","excerpt":"Grindlists is a web application designed to help gamers organize their grinding sessions.
