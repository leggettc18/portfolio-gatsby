For any readers who don't know what that means, sometimes a game\nrequires a player to collect materials to complete a quest or craft an item.\nSometimes those items also require crafting intermediate items, and it can be a\nlot to keep track of. The goal of Grindlists is to help gamers keep track of\nwhat items they need, how many they need, and where those items can be found.\n\nGrindlists is comprised of a React Frontend and a GraphQL backend. It currently\nuses JWT token-based authentication (with plans to implement OAuth support), a \nPostgresQL database for storage, and a Redis server for caching. The main thing\nI experimented with when building this project is code generators, which I will\nelaborate on below.\n\nThe Backend for Grindlists is written in Go. The GraphQL server was generated\n[gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/), which handles most of the boilerplate code for you, but leaves the\nnon-trivial resolvers (basically anything that needs to interact with the database)\nfor the developer to implement themselves. Said database interaction code was \ngenerated by [sqlc](https://sqlc.dev/), which generates database code based on a schema file\nwritten in SQL, and a file describing SQL queries, written in SQL with some extra\ncomments. The generated code is then wrapped up in an interface that can add\nadditional methods for any database operations that are easier written in Go by\ncombining other existing database queries (Creating an Item and adding it to a\nlist at the same time, for example).\n\nThe Frontend is written in React with Typescript. The code generation happening\nhere is with [graphql-codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/), which generates code to interface with the\nGraphQL API and properly assign types to the response data. The rest of it is a \nfairly standard React + Next.js app.\n\nThere is currently no live demo for Grindlists, and not all of the API functionality\nhas been implemented in the frontend yet. However, feel free to check it out\non GitHub, if you have Docker, docker-compose and Make, then the dev environemnt\nsetup is pretty simple to do.","excerpt":"Grindlists is a web application designed to help gamers organize their grinding sessions.
