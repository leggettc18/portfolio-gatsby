It \nis still in development so certain aspects of it are subject to change.\n\n![Devmarks Logo](./devmarks.png)\n\nPlanned features include organizing bookmarks into folders and tags, and \norganizing users into organizations to more quickly share bookmarks and folders \nwith a group of users.\n\nOn the more technical side, the app uses a VueJS 3.0 + Typescript frontend, \nwith a REST API backend written in Golang. It uses PostgresQL for its database,\nleveraging the GORM library for ORM capabilities, and takes advantage of JWT token-based \nauthentication. Currently authentication is just done with an email and password. \nOAuth is on the list of things to do as the project advances.\n\nThe Web Frontend is written in VueJS 3.0. It utilizes Vue Router for routing,\nHeadlessUI for some basic building blocks, HeroIcons for icons,and Tailwind CSS \nfor styling. I have utilized OpenAPI 3.0 generators to describe the backend API\nwith an openapi.yml file and generated a Typescript/Axios client on the frontend,\nwhich I have wrapped up in the frontend to make a few of my common use cases\nmore convenient.\n\nThere is currently a demo hosted at [demo.devmarks.app](https://demo.devmarks.app).\nThis is still in what I would call alpha stages, so there may be bugs and\ndata may be wiped at any time. Feel free to \n[submit an issue](https://github.com/leggettc18/devmarks/issues) \nif you come across any bugs!\n","excerpt":"Devmarks is a bookmark manager intended for teams of developers to share bookmarks to documentation, intranet sites, and other valuableâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"id":"bd33502a-1e63-5bd4-b88b-9093d4e03635","fields__slug":"devmarks","__params":{"fields__slug":"devmarks"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Devmarks","author":"Christopher Leggett","date":"2020-09-13T21:22:48.000Z","Descripion":"Bookmark Manager for Teams of Developers","Tags":["developers","organization","bookmarks","go","rest","api","devmarks"],"Categories":["Portfolio"],"github":"https://github.com/leggettc18/devmarks","image":"devmarks.png","portfolioScore":1000,"featured":true}}},"staticQueryHashes":["2535782836"],"slicesMap":{}}
