The commonly used overlay available only\nsupported predictions with 2 outcomes, so the goal was to make\none that supported an arbitrary number of outcomes. You can use\nit by going to [https://twitch.leggett.dev]() and linking your Twitch\naccount! The homepage includes a demo to showcase approximately\nwhat it will look like in your streaming software and if you're signed\nin it will give you a link to copy.\n\nCurrently, the overlay supports predictions with an arbitrary number\nof outcomes, but you may have some clarity issues after about 10.\nIt also gives you a few options for the layout and direction.\nFor example, if you want to put the prediction across\nthe bottom of your stream, you will want to select Horizontal\nfor the Layout and End for the Direction. If you want it along the\nleft side of your stream layout, you want to choose Vertical and\nStart. Under the hood, these go into the url parameters, so if you\nwant different scenes to have different layouts, you can simply\nset up multiple Browser Sources in your streaming software of choice\nwith different URLs.\n\nUnder the hood, this is implemented in Next.js via the\n[t3 stack](https://create.t3.gg). Ultimately it's a fairly simple\napp. All it does is store authentication tokens obtained via OAuth.\nThen, those tokens are used on the page for the actual overlay to set\nup the WebSocket connection, subscribe to the Prediction related\nmessages, parse the incoming messages, and display the results.\nI chose the t3 stack because it scaffolded out the basic app stuff\nand let me focus on the meat of the project, which was interfacing\nwith Twitch's WebSocket API.\n\nCurrently, this is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the\ndatabase is hosted on [Turso](turso.tech), on the free tiers for\nboth of them. It used to be hosted on PlanetScale, until they \n[deprecated their free tier](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/hobby-plan-deprecation-faq).\nIf you have found this project useful and want to get it off of the\nfree tier, please consider donating to my [Ko-Fi](ko-fi.com/leggettc18)!\nI would really appreciate it!\n","excerpt":"Twitch Predictions Overlay is a custom overlay I wrote to use on Twitch.
